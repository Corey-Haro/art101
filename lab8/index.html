					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> The chalange of this lab was to experiment with 
                        callback and anonymous functions. We were also encuraged to create 
                        another lab file from scratch. 
                    </p>
            </div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> I think a problem that I faced was not typing in the code correctly 
                        when trying to be diffrent and use multiplication instead of addition 
                    and subtraction. Which I ened up just using addition and subtraction. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> This lab was a little more cumbersome, with the steps we had to follow and the 
                        constanly having to create a new file, overall it was an easy concept to digest.
