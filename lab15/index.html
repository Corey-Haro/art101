					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> the challange for this lab was to create a random 
                        image generator using jQuery and AJAX </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> I honestly had no problems, there wasnt any issues or 
                        road blocks. I think the only issue I had was not putting 
                        my commas which I ended up catching on to early on, so I 
                        was able to avoid the problem. 
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> I enjoyed this lab, I feel like seeing what we 
                        learned in class come to life fills in the parts I 
                        was confused on.
