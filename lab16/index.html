					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> The challange for this last lab was to create a 
                        choose your adventure game using JSON and APIs </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> The only problem I truly had was using my notes and slides
                        to help me walk through this process (including help from
                        Cella). Which made me confused but I ultimately figured it out. 
					</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> Since this is the last lab I wanted to recognize my growth
                        within this class, although I've talked about it before, I went
                        into this class knowing nothing about coding and came out
                        understanding the basics of HTML. It is insane that I have come this far.
                        I don't like most stem classes but this one was by far my favorite class,
                        I am going to miss this 8 a.m.
