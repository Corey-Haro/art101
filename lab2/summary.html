					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challange was, with the help of a partner, create an HTML with the tittle "Hello World"
						and a little paragraph talking about your partner. The lab also had us costomize the web page 
						using VSCode.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The problem that emerged was my image would not load on the published website, 
						turns out I just needed to move it to the correct file. Also if there were any other issues,
						Cella was there to help me and guide me in the right direction. 
						(this is me sighting her as a source because I used some of her code to help me center my image) </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I think this project went quite well, I was able to undertand the fundimentals of making a website from scratch. 
						I was also taught how to link my pages and put that into practice. As a beginner coder I am starting to grasp 
						certain subjects and concepts about coding. 
					</p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> We were able to create some cute and colorful websites :D</p>
