			<h1>Lab 7 - Function </h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> The challange for this lab was to create a whole new 
                        file from scratch in the css, img, js, and html format.
                        Then we were directed to create a string of functions in javascript in 
                        order to undertand the diffrent parts of javascript code. 
                        Most of my code I used from Professor Modes! 
                    </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I think the only problem that I ran into was the 
                        structure of the website, due to the fact that I used one of my other 
                        labs as a refence so that threw me through a loop, but 
                        it was easy to figure out.  
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I feel like with each lab I start to undersantd more and more 
                        what each part of the code means, although thats the point, 
                        it amazes me how much I am starting to understand. 
                    </p>
