            and keep them well managed and maintained.

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>To be quite frank I feel that the second lab helped me undertsand
            the foundations on how to build a website, so i fellt like I was doing that process 
            once more. one of the difficult challanges I faced was in lab 2 
            I accidentaly created more then one css file which made it a little confusing but I orginized it well.
