			<h1>Lab 13 - Loops</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> The challenge for this lab was to create an infinite loop that 
						detailed different elements that correspond to imputed 
						numbers, this was completed with the help of javascript and jQuery.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> The problem I faced was that my results would not show up, 
						when I would correctly input the information and hit the run button, 
						the results would not appear. I was at my computer for a total of 3 hours 
						looking through my code to see what I might have missed, it turns out I had
						 a div with a / instead of a div without one (which is the proper way) and
						  that is what disrupted the code.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> This lab was the worst It had me pulling my hair out and wanting to bite a brick.
						the process was very tedious, however rewarding in the end.
					</p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> The fruit of my labor are down below!</p>
